Represent a picture as the height and width, and a sequence of drawing
commands to build it. Also has an initial background colour. Each command
starts at the current location and draws a certain number of spaces to get
to the next location. If a colour is given, it paints over the spaces
in-between, including the final destination space, but not the initial
space. Otherwise, it just updates the position. If the distance is 0, than
the command just updates the colour of the current position, and does not
update the position.

The starting position is at (0,0), the top, left corner of the drawing.

For example, starting with a 4x2 picture of all 0's

00
00
00
00

the command 'down 2 1' changes the image as follows and leaves the current
position at (2,0) -- down 2 and over none

00
10
10
00

Then 'right 1 2' changes the position to (2,1) and updates the image

00
10
12
00

then 'up 1' leaves the image unchanged, but updated the current position to (1,1)
finally 'up 1 9` makes the position (0,1) -- the top right -- and the image

09
10
12
00

If we then execute 'down 0 4' the position is not updated, so we stay at the
top right.

NB commands with distance 0 are the *only* commands that can change the
colour of the pixel that they start on.
